# Arrays 

### Description 

Array is a container wich can hold a fix number of items and these
items should be of the same type. 

- **Element**: each item stored in an array is called an element. 
- **Index**: each location of an element in an array has a numerical index,
which is used to identify the element. 

### Declaration 

It varies depending on the language. A C array declaration:

```c
int array[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```

Important things to have in mind:
- Index starts at 0
- Array lenght is 10 which means it can store 10 elements
- Each element can be accessed via its index.

### Basic Operation

- Traverse - print all elements one by one 
- Instersion - adds an element at the given index
- Deletion - deletes an element at the given index
- Search - searches an element using the given index or by the value
- Update - updates an element at the given index

In C, when an array is initialized with size, it assigns default values to its 
elements.


## Operations

### Insertion operation 

Insert operation is to add one or more data elements into an array. A new element can be inserted at the beginning, end or any given index of array.

Here we see an [example](https://www.github.com/) of insertion where we add data at the end of the array.
