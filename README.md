# Array vs Linked List

| 		**Parameter**			| **Array**		    | **Linked List**	| **Better for parameter**	|
| ------------- 	| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cost of accesing an element  | Constant time O(1)| Average case O(n) 	| Array			|
|					|				|				|				|
|  	|  | 	| 	|
| Memory requirements | Fixed size	| No unused memory | Depends on size of the list	| 
|| Memory may not be available as one large block| Extra memory for pointer variables		| Memory fragmentation - Linked list is better* 				|
|  	|  | 	| 	|



* Sometimes we may get many small units of memory, but we may not get one larga block.
